    <h1>Progressive Equity Calculator</h1>

    <p>This tool calculates potential payouts to founders and employees under a progressive equity
      scheme. The idea behind progressive equity is to allow founders and early employees to share
      wealth created by a very large exit with employees that have smaller holdings.
    </p>
    <p>It was popularized in this article by Groupon's co-founder, Andrew Mason:<br>

      <h3>How it Works</h3>
      <p>Once a founder and/or employee has reached a pre-set "financial independence number",
        additional earnings are taxed (usually at 50%) and put into a kicker pool. This pool
        is distributed to the remaining employees on a pro-rata basis.
      </p>
      <p>For example, if the "financial independence number" is set to $15mm and the company
        sells for $100mm. A founder owning 25% of the company will receive $20mm
        instead of $25mm. The remaining $5mm will fund the kicker pool and be distributed among the
        rest of the employees.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an employee your share of the kicker pool is equal to your equity holdings
        divided by the total equity owned by all the eligible employees times the kicker pool.
        For example if you owned 1% and all the eligible employees together owned 20%,
        you would get 1/20th of the $5mm kicker pool, equal to $250,000, on top of the $1mm
        you would otherwise receive in a $100mm exit.
      </p>
      <p>In order to receive monies from the kicker pool, an individual must still be
        an employee at the time of the exit. Former employees will be subject to the
        tax, but not the redistribution. Investors are not subject to progressive equity, unless
        you somehow talked them into it.
