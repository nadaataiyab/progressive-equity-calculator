# progressive-equity-calculator
A simple program written in Python to help companies project pay-outs from a progressive equity arrangement. Under "progressive equity", once an equity holder reaches the pre-set financial independence number during an exit, 50% of their additional equity will be re-distributed to other equity holders. 

It's still under development, but the most current code is in the folder marked v2.
