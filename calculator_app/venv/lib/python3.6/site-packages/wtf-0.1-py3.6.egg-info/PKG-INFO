Description: **WTF** is a Python post-mortem debug handler.
        
        After an exception, a Pdb debugger will be started in the frame and line where
        the exception was raised. The `IPython <http://ipython.scipy.org/>`_ debugger
        will be used by default if available, Otherwise Python's own ``pdb.Pdb``.

        Usage
        =====
        
        If ``with`` statement block support is available (default since 2.6), then **WTF**
        can be used as::
        
            from wtf import WTF
        
            with WTF:
                ... do something ...
        
        If an exception is raised inside the ``with`` block, then a Pdb debugger will be
        started on the conflicting line.
        
        **WTF** can be used as a function call also, with the same results.::
        
            from wtf import WTF
        
            try:
                ... do something ...
            except:
                WTF()
        
        For more info, check the ``wtf.WTFHandler`` class.
